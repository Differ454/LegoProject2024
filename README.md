Project README
Project Title: 3D Lego-Repository Application

Welcome to the 3D Lego-Inspired Application repository! This project is a unique blend of creativity and technology, designed to provide an immersive and interactive 3D experience inspired by the beloved world of Lego.

Overview
This project leverages modern web development technologies to create a visually stunning and highly interactive application. Built with React, Vite, and Node.js, and incorporating 3D elements using the Three.js library, this project stands as a testament to the power and versatility of these tools.


Features
3D Interactivity: Utilizing Three.js, the project offers dynamic and interactive 3D models reminiscent of Lego creations.

Modern Frontend: The application is developed with React, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Efficient Build Tooling: Vite is employed for its fast build times and hot module replacement, enhancing the development experience.

Robust Backend: Node.js powers the backend, providing a scalable and efficient server environment.

Technology Stack

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its declarative, component-based approach.

Vite: A modern build tool that offers an extremely fast development environment and optimized build process.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, ideal for building scalable network applications.

Three.js: A cross-browser JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
